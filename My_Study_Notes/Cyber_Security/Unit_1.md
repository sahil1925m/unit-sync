2. Spamming
Definition: Spamming is the act of sending unsolicited bulk messages (junk mail) to a large number of recipients indiscriminately.

Unsolicited: The receiver did not ask for it.

Bulk: It is sent to millions of people at once.

While we usually think of spam as annoying "Ads," in Cyber Security, it is considered a crime because it steals resources (bandwidth and storage) and spreads danger.

How it Works (The Mechanism):

Harvesting: Spammers use software (crawlers) to scan websites, chat rooms, and social media to collect millions of active email addresses.

Botnets: To avoid getting blocked, spammers don't send emails from their own computers. They use Botnets (a network of thousands of infected computers) to send the emails for them.

Sending: The spam is blasted out to the harvested list.

Types of Spam (for Exam):

Commercial Spam: Ads for illegal drugs, fake watches, lottery scams, or "get rich quick" schemes.

Malicious Spam: Emails that contain viruses, spyware, or links to phishing websites.

Why is it a Cyber Crime?

Resource Theft: It floods the network, slowing down the internet for everyone (Bandwidth Theft).

Storage Cost: Companies have to spend millions on servers just to store and filter out junk mail.

Security Risk: It is the primary delivery method for Ransomware and Phishing attacks.

Summary for your Notes:

Keyword: Unsolicited Bulk Email (UBE).

Tool: Botnets.

Impact: Wastes bandwidth and spreads malware.
